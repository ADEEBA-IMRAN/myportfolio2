                <p style="color: lightsalmon; font-family: cursive; font-size: 30px; padding-top: 3%;">Pizza Delicious is an American restaurant chain and international franchise based in Addison, Texas (a northern suburb of Dallas), offering different styles of pizza along with side dishes including pasta, buffalo wings, breadsticks, and garlic bread. Pizza Hut is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, Inc., the worldâ€™s largest restaurant company, with approximately 34,000 restaurants, delivery-carry out units, and kiosks in 100 countries.</p>

    <P  style="font-size: 25PX; font-family: cursive; color:lightsalmon; text-align: center; padding-top: 2%;">The Pizza Delicious story begins in May 1958. Dan and Frank Carney opened their 550-square foot pizza restaurant in Wichita, Kansas. Dan and Frank, with friends Richard Beemer and John Bender, made the pizza themselves. Frank rolled the dough with a rolling pin. Richard tossed the dough in the air from the pie tin. Dan filled the unbaked crust with sauce. John flipped the pie from the tin during the baking process. Dan Carney recalled, "The people were enchanted with the product, watching us tossing the dough over our heads. They were really enjoying themselves"</P>
    <P style="font-size: 25PX; font-family: cursive; color: lightsalmon; text-align: center; padding-top: 2%;">The Carneys created an innovative, high quality, engaging, informal eating experience in a friendly neighborhood restaurant. Pizza Hut became a popular place with the teenage and college crowd. Pizza Hut attracted families that enjoyed a night out eating a meal that they would not be having at home. After the families left, Pizza Hut transformed itself into a hangout for college-age kids. Having a good time was an essential part of Pizza Hut. The idea caught on. A second Pizza Hut opened in December 1958 in downtown Wichita. By 1963, there were forty-two Pizza Hut restaurants.</P>
    <P style="font-size: 25PX; font-family: cursive; color: lightsalmon; text-align: center; padding-top: 2%;">The first Pizza Hut Restaurant in Pakistan was opened in December 1993 and took the culinary scene by surprise. From that time onwards, the brand has contributed heavily towards the development of society as a whole. It is responsible for creating job opportunities for the youth of the country both directly as well as indirectly. Furthermore, Pizza Hut during the core of its existence has gradually aided in the development of various local suppliers who as a requirement have to supply food staff equivalent in quality to the international food standards. In this regard, our restaurant chain has proved to be a major contributor towards the progress of the Pakistani food industry as a whole by bringing it to a point where they can now look forward to supplying their items to other chains as well as the international market.</P>
    <P style="font-size: 25PX; font-family: cursive; color: lightsalmon; text-align: center; padding-top: 2%;">Pizza Hut, being the first International franchise to enter the Pakistani market has set new standards of dine-in restaurants and quick delivery of oven-hot pizzas and has since then enjoyed tremendous brand loyalty from its customers.</P>
